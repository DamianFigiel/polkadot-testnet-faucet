## What is this?

This is a Enjin-testnet faucet. You can use this to load testnet tokens into your account.

## What is a faucet?

A faucet is a developer tool to get a small amount of testnet tokens (<NETWORK-TOKEN>) in order to test and troubleshoot a decentralized application or protocol before going live on Enjin Blockchain, where one must use real ENJ.

Most faucets require social authentication (e.g. Twitter post or login confirming you are a real human) or place you in a queue to wait for a testnet token through the faucet.

## How do I use this?

To request funds, simply enter your <NETWORK-NAME> wallet address, fill the captcha, and hit "Submit".

## How much <NETWORK-TOKEN> will I receive?

You will receive 100 <NETWORK-TOKEN> per request.

## How often can I request tokens?

You can request tokens every 24h! If you request <NETWORK-TOKEN> for one account, you can't request more for another parachain in that period.

## What is a testnet token?

Testnet tokens are a test currency that allows you to test your Polkadot application before going live. Testnet tokens can be used in place of real tokens on testnets like <NETWORK-NAME>.

## Can I get real ENJ?

No, we will provide you with TEST ENJ, so you can do your testing and move it to any parachain whenever you are ready
